16S rRNA amplicon analysis of soil microbial diversity in Gordon Square Park using QIIME
27 samples were collected from Gordon Square Park. DNA was extracted, purifed and amplified using PCR. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was carried out on the illumina MiSeq platform to obtain raw sequencing data in FASTAQ format. FASTAQ files, along with the mapping file containing all sample metadata, were uploaded to the SURFsara high performance computer cluster Cartesius and analysed using QIIME. All scripts used in analysis are shown below. The first part of each script describes the cluster resources required to run to script (#SBATCH) which is followed by the QIME python subscript. Scripts were created in .pbs files and submitted using the code 'sbatch'. Further details of the QIIME scripts used in analysis can be found on the QIIME website (http://qiime.org).
